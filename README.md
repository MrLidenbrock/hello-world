# hello-world
My very first repository

I've decided that this new branch is going to be my personal binnacle. Where I will practice my grammar and writing (excuse me in advance) because my mother tongue isn't English, it is Spanish. Also I will post any ideas related to my studies in Physics and related work, or anything else I learned over the years.

Soooooo, to sum up: I will write anything that comes out of my brain. Basically that's the idea.
